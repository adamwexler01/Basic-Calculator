# Basic-Calculator
Basic Calculator is a simple Javascript Application. The objective of this application was to develop a calculator that can perform
the same operations as a four function calculator. Just like a four function, this calculator can perform the following:

  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division

To use these operations, the user must include a space betweeen each of the integers and symbols. If this condition is not put into
place, then the calculator will not peform correctly.

  
# Future Versions
Basic Calculator will expand to allow parenthesis and PEMDAS. Also, this application will allow for other user functionality. This
project was just used to help me (the developer) learn about Node.js and being able to create a javascript application using the
command prompt.
